**Variables in Python**
=====================

In Python, variables are used to store values. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character, cannot start with a number, and can only contain alpha-numeric characters. Variables are declared by assigning a value to them using the assignment operator =, without specifying the type of variable.

**Assignment Operator**
----------------------

The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:
```python
x = 5
```
In this example, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x.

**Shallow and Deep Copying**
-----------------------------

When copying variables in Python, there are two types of copying: shallow and deep copying.

*   **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new compound object and then references the objects contained in the original within it. This means that if you modify an object referenced by the new copy, the original object will also be modified.
*   **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new compound object and then recursively inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

**Example: Shallow Copy**
-------------------------

```python
original_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
new_list = original_list.copy()
print(new_list)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Modifying an object referenced by new_list will also modify the original list
new_list[0][0] = 'X'
print(original_list)  # Output: [['X', 2], [3, 4]]
```

**Example: Deep Copy**
----------------------

```python
import copy

original_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
print(new_list)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Modifying an object referenced by new_list will not modify the original list
new_list[0][0] = 'X'
print(original_list)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

**Variable Reassignment**
-------------------------

In Python, variables can be reassigned to different values. For example:
```python
x = 5
x = 'Hello'
print(x)  # Output: Hello
```
In this example, the variable x is first assigned the value 5 and then reassigned the value 'Hello'.

**Variable Creation**
----------------------

Variables can be created from existing variables using assignment. For example:
```python
original_name = 'James'
new_name = original_name
print(new_name)  # Output: James

# Reassigning new_name will not affect the original variable
new_name = 'Alfredo'
print(original_name)  # Output: James
```
In this example, a new variable new\_name is created by assigning the value of the existing variable original\_name. The reassignment of new\_name does not affect the original variable.

**Printing Variables**
----------------------

Variables can be printed using the print() function. For example:
```python
x = 5
y = 'Hello'
print(x, y)  # Output: 5 Hello
```
In this example, the values of two variables x and y are printed to the console.
